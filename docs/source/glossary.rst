   DGGS
      Discrete Global Grid System. A spatial framework that partitions the Earth's surface into a hierarchical set of cells with specific geometric and topological properties.

   GDAL
      Geospatial Data Abstraction Library. A translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats that is released under an X/MIT style open source license.

   GeoJSON
      A format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

   MPAS
      Model for Prediction Across Scales. A collaborative project for developing atmosphere, ocean, and other earth-system simulation components for use in climate, regional climate, and weather studies.

   NetCDF
      Network Common Data Form. A set of software libraries and self-describing, machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.

   OGR
      Originally "OpenGIS Simple Features Reference Implementation", now part of GDAL. A library for reading and writing vector geospatial data formats.

   Raster Data
      A spatial data model that defines space as an array of equally sized cells arranged in rows and columns, and composed of single or multiple bands.

   TIN
      Triangulated Irregular Network. A vector data structure that partitions geographic space into contiguous, non-overlapping triangles.

   Unstructured Mesh
      A mesh where the connectivity between nodes is not regular or predictable, allowing for flexible representation of complex geometries.

   Vector Data
      A spatial data model that represents geographic features as points, lines, and polygons with associated attributes.

   Zonal Statistics
      Statistical analysis performed on raster data within defined geographic zones or areas, typically polygons.
